# CAT 1: Concepts Test

Our first CAT will be a written test covering the Python concepts from [Unit 2](/modules/u2_codingFundamentals). There will be five sections:

1. Several multiple choice questions covering a variety of Python commands and concepts.
2. One [Tracing](/modules/u2_codingFundamentals/tracing) question.
3. One [Debugging](/modules/u2_codingFundamentals/debugging) question.
4. One [Complete the Code](/modules/u2_codingFundamentals/completeTheCode) question.
5. One [Commenting](/modules/u2_codingFundamentals/commenting) question.

You will be allowed one A4 double-sided cheat sheet (handwritten). Refer to the [Unit 2 Review](/modules/u2_codingFundamentals/review) for a list of concepts to study.
